# Arduino Powered CNC Drawing Machine
3D Printed Arduino Powered CNC Drawing Machine

How to make a simple and high quality CNC drawing machine to draw on almost anything. I'll step you through how to build your own including all the files you need.

This project has a relatively low cost and can produce some very detailed drawings. I've used it to create t-shirts, cake decorations, drawings to colour in myself (and some it coloured in for me!). You could also use it to draw out scale drawings, wedding invitations, birthday and Christmas cards and anything else you can think of. :)
